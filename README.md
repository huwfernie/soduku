This is a small game project that will aim to solve a sudoku puzzle. Their will be a few test games built in, or you can enter your own start condition, it will also log each move that it makes.

This is front end only, so javascript and html for now.


Aims and Objectives:
- An HTML & CSS grid similar to a Sudoku grid from a newspaper.
- A button that will auto-fill a random Sudoku game (javascript).
- An HTML & CSS list of numbers 1-9.
- A drag and drop feature from the number-list into the grid (javascript).
- A button that will solve the game (javascript).
